# Name-Information-Aggregator
OSINT tool for data aggregation relying on various other sites

To run, do the following:

1. Install Meteor JS

2. Run this in a terminal:
meteor npm install --save angular angular-meteor phantomjs angular-messages

This app doesn't really work because of some phantom js issues. I will have to make improvements eventually.
